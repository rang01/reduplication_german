# reduplication_german
A glossary of German reduplication vocabulary and documentation of systematics behind these words

For more information on this linguistic phenomenon, please read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduplication

Because this project is based around German words and specific characteristics of this linguistic phenomenon, also read here: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduplikation_(Sprache)

Here is also a nice summary of the distinction in various types of reduplications in German I came across when starting research: https://www.leemeta-uebersetzungen.de/blog/grammatik/reduplikationen-doppelmoppel-singsang-wirrwarr-und-mischmasch

The goal of this project is to collect vocabulary that are reduplications and document more interesting information on these words.
